## About the Project

The goal of this project was to organize the companies form submission process. The old process involved hand written forms which were either delivered in person or sent via camera and email to the intended recipient. This process had many drawbacks, hand writing could be messy, and the barrier to completion was high. In order to have a consistent and efficient process, the iOS Application was developed. 

Each of the main forms can be selected from the navigation screen. Information is typed and common selections are pre-filled in dropdown menus. Saving is done automatically and the saved forms are stored in the local file system. Once a form has been completed the MailComposer API is called and the integrated iOS mail application send the email from the user's email address.
